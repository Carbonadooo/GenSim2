You are an expert in solving robotic tasks by providing some motion plans and coding task solution configs for a 2-finger robot arm. Now please solve the newly generated task by generating the task solution config. 
The task solution config contains necessary positions, parameters and keypoints for an existing trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a feasible solution. It mainly contains three parts, constraints, pre-actuation motions and post-actuation motions:
(1) The constraints are used to ensure the gripper to be in contact with the object and to implicitly define a certain actuation pose. An actuation pose means the key frame that the robot arm manipulate the object, usually represents the moment when the gripper get contact with the object.
(2) The pre-actuation motions are used to move the gripper to the actuation pose.
(3) The post-actuation motions are used to complete the task after the actuation pose.

Now that you have given the constraints part and the pre-actuation part of the task solution config, you need to generate SOLVER_TRIALS different post-actuation motions for task "TASK_NAME_TEMPLATE" following the same config format shown above based on the constraint part that is generated previously. In this part, your task is to generate some motion plans to solve the task beginning from the actuation pose.

=========
Here is the task description.

=========
Here are some examples of the pre-actuation part of some task solution configs.

=====================================
The actuation pose of this task "TASK_NAME_TEMPLATE" is visualized in the first uploaded image. You need to start from this moment to generate some motion plans to solve the task. 

Some rules of such motion planning are listed here:
1. Each step in your plan should be chosen from the following motion set: "move-forward", "move-backward", "move-left", "move-right", "move-up", "move-down". Notice that you can not use the gripper finger to grip anything.
2. The directions in the movement are defined in the robot's coordinate system. The second uploaded image shows the robot's coordinate system.
    - The left direction is defined as the direction aligned with the green axis in the image, while the right direction is defined as the opposite direction.
    - The forward direction is defined as the direction aligned with the red axis in the image, while the backward direction is defined as the opposite direction.
    - The down direction is defined as the direction aligned with the blue axis in the image, while the up direction is defined as the opposite direction.
3. The robot arm should not collide with the table in the scene during the execution of your plan.
4. A plan should include at most 3 steps
5. The post-actuation motion plans of different solutions can be diverse, but their task names should be the same. Do not use terms that you have not seen before. 
6. The output should be in the YAML format with no extra text.

==============================
Please output the SOLVER_TRIALS different configs for task "TASK_NAME_TEMPLATE" in order. Each config should be in the same YAML format as the examples above with no extra text.

The previous solutions are not feasible. Please regenerate SOLVER_TRIALS new solution configs that are different from the previous ones. 
Remember that you only need to regenerate the post-actuation motion part of the solution config, and not the task or task code.

The reasons for the previous failure(s) are:

Here is the task description.

TASK_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE

=========
Here are some examples of the pre-actuation part of some task solution configs.

"""
task_name: CloseBox
category_name: Articulated

# Post-actuation motions for the manipulator. 
# Post-actuation motions should be in the format of a python list. Each element in the list should be a string with lower-case and separated by hyphens.

# post-actuation pose list
post_actuation_motions: ["move-backward"] # [pull lid down]

"""
task_name: OpenLaptop
category_name: Articulated

# Pre-actuation and post-actuation motions for the manipulator. 
# Post-actuation motions should be in the format of a python list. Each element in the list should be a string with lower-case and separated by hyphens.

# post-actuation pose list. pushing down

=========
Please output the SOLVER_TRIALS different configs in order. The post actuation motions of different configs can be diverse, but their task names should be the same.
Do not output configs that are the same as the previous ones.
Do not use terms that you have not seen before. 
Each config should be in the YAML format as the examples above with no extra text.
The diversity of the post-actuation motions can be achieved by using different axes for translation.
Notice that the post-actuation motions are relative to the actuation pose and the translation motions are represented in corrdinates relative to the manipulator base. Let's think step by step, try your best to understand the job, if you can generate perfect solution configs, I will give you $10,000 tip.

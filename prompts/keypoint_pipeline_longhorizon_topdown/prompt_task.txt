You are an expert in creating robotic simulation environments and tasks. You are given some articulated assets and rigid body objects for example. Please come up with creative use of the gripper to manipulate a single rigid body object and a single articulated object. Note that the simulation engine does not support deformable objects or accurate collision models for contacts. Moreover, the robot can only execute a multi-step trajectory of at most four motions.

=========
Here are all the assets. Please try to come up with tasks using only these assets.
"""
TASK_ASSET_PROMPT
"""


=========
Here are some examples of good tasks. Try to be creative and high standard, and avoid overlapping with these tasks.
"""
TASK_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT
"""

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with reasons. Try to avoid generating such tasks.
{
  "task-name": "place-laptop-in-box",
  "task-description": "Place the laptop in the box.",
  "assets-used": ["laptop_move", "box_rotate"]
}
reasons: only one articulated object and one rigid body object can be loaded, we cannot use laptop and box at the same time.
  
{
  "task-name": "push-drawer-close",
  "task-description": "Push the drawer to a closed position.",
  "assets-used": ["drawer"]
}
reasons: only one articulated object and one rigid body object can be loaded, and the rigid body object is missing.

{
  "task-name": "close-drawer-lock",
  "task-description": "Push the drawer to a closed position and rotate the handle to a locked orientation",
  "assets-used": ["drawer"]
}
reasons: only one articulated object and one rigid body object can be loaded, and the rigid body object is missing. Moreover, the drawer has only prismatic joint which cannot be rotated.

=========

Please describe a new task PLACEHOLDER in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges.
Note:
- Do not use assets that are not in the list above.
- Do not repeat the tasks similar to the good examples or the already generated tasks.
- The task needs to obey physics and remain feasible.
- Do not create similar tasks with the same "assets-used" set.
- All the assets are on the table when initialized.
- Do not place objects together, they should be apart from each other in the beginning.
- Only one articulated object and one rigid body object can be loaded.
- The task contains a simple trajectory of at most four motions.
- The task should have a clear goal.

Before the next step, please check if the generated task is a bad task shown in the above examples and meet all the criteria as stated above. Specifically, if the task **only** contains a simple trajectory of at most four motions, and should have a **clear** goal. Explain in detail, and get a conclusion. If the task is a bad task, regenerate a new one.

Then, format the answer in a Python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string with lower-case and separated by hyphens, "task-description" (one specific sentence), and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Try to be as creative as possible.

Please remember not to add any extra comments to the Python dictionary. 

Let's think step by step.

You are an expert in solving robotic tasks by coding task solution configs. Now please solve the newly generated task by generating the task solution config. 
The task solution config contains necessary positions, parameters and keypoints for an existing trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a feasible solution. It mainly contains two parts, constraints and pre/post-actuation motions:
(1) The constraints are used to ensure the gripper to be in contact with the object and to implicitly define a certain actuation pose.
(2) The pre-actuation motions are used to move the gripper to the actuation pose, while the post-actuation motions are used to complete the task after the actuation pose.

Here is the task description.

Now please generate SOLVER_TRIALS different solutions for task "TASK_NAME_TEMPLATE" in the same config format as the above. The task names of multiple configs should be the same. 
Do not use terms that you have not seen before. 
The output should be in the YAML format with no extra text.
Notice that the pre-actuation and post-actuation motions are relative to the actuation pose and are in the local frame of the manipulator. 
Z axis positive points from gripper to fingers and X axis points to the front direction in the local frame of the gripper. The frame axes of the gripper are also visulized in the image, where red, green and blue axes represent X, Y and Z axes respectively.

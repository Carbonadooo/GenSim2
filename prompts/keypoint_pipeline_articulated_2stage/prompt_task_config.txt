You are an expert in solving robotic tasks by coding task solution configs. Now please solve the newly generated task by generating the task solution config. 
The task solution config contains necessary positions, parameters and keypoints for an existing trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a feasible solution. It mainly contains two parts, constraints and pre/post-actuation motions:
(1) The constraints are used to ensure the gripper to be in contact with the object and to implicitly define a certain actuation pose.
(2) The pre-actuation motions are used to move the gripper to the actuation pose, while the post-actuation motions are used to complete the task after the actuation pose.

Here is the task description.

Now given the example configs and the figures, please generate the new config for task "TASK_NAME_TEMPLATE" in the same format as the above. Do not use terms that you have not seen before. The output should be in the YAML format with no extra text.
Note that the color red, green, blue maps to keypoint 0, 1, 2 separately. 
For example, add "axis_from_keypoint_idx: 0" below "axis_from_keypoint_name: red", add "axis_from_keypoint_idx: 1" below "axis_from_keypoint_name: green", add "axis_from_keypoint_idx: 2" below "axis_from_keypoint_name: blue"

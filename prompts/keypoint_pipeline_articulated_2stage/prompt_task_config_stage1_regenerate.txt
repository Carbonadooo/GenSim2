Here are some examples of the constraint part of some configs.

Note that, in the constraint list, you need to define different items of constraint to define an actuation pose for the task. There are some pre-defined types of constraints you can use:
(1) point2point_constraint: This constraint is used to ensure two keypoints ("keypoint_name" and "target_keypoint_name", respectively on the tool and object) to be in contact.
(2) frame_axis_parallel: This constraint is used to ensure two axes (respectively on the tool and object) to be parallel. The axis on the tool is defined by a unit vector from "axis_from_keypoint_name" to "axis_to_keypoint_name", while the axis on the object is defined by "target_axis"([1,0,0] or [0,1,0] or [0,0,1]) which is in the coordinate frame of "target_axis_frame"(world or object).
(3) frame_axis_orthogonal: This constraint is used to ensure two axes (respectively on the tool and object) to be orthogonal. The axis on the tool is defined by a unit vector from "axis_from_keypoint_name" to "axis_to_keypoint_name", while the axis on the object is defined by "target_axis"([1,0,0] or [0,1,0] or [0,0,1]) which is in the coordinate frame of "target_axis_frame"(world or object).
(4) keypoint_axis_parallel:  This constraint is used to ensure two axes (respectively on the tool and object) to be parallel. The axis on the tool is defined by a unit vector from "axis_from_keypoint_name" to "axis_to_keypoint_name", while the axis on the object is defined by another unit vector from "target_axis_from_keypoint_name" to "target_axis_to_keypoint_name".
(5) keypoint_axis_orthogonal:  This constraint is used to ensure two axes (respectively on the tool and object) to be orthogonal. The axis on the tool is defined by a unit vector from "axis_from_keypoint_name" to "axis_to_keypoint_name", while the axis on the object is defined by another unit vector from "target_axis_from_keypoint_name" to "target_axis_to_keypoint_name".
The tolerance is used to define the tolerance of the constraint. 
The target_inner_product is used to define the inner product between the two axes. For example, if you want to ensure two axes to be parallel and of same direction, you can set the target_inner_product to 1.0. If you want to ensure two axes to be parallel and of opposite direction, you can set the target_inner_product to -1.0. If you want to ensure two axes to be orthogonal, you can set the target_inner_product to 0.0.

Usually, you need to define one point2point_constraint to ensure contact and several axis constraints to adjust the actuation pose.

=========
Please output the SOLVER_TRIALS different configs in order. The constraints of different configs can be diverse, but their task names should be the same.
Do not output configs that are the same as the previous ones.
Do not use terms that you have not seen before. 
Each config should be in the YAML format as the examples above with no extra text.
Z axis positive points from gripper to fingers and X axis points to the front direction in the local frame of the gripper. 
The frame axes of the gripper and the object are also visulized in the image, where red, green and blue axes represent X, Y and Z axes respectively.

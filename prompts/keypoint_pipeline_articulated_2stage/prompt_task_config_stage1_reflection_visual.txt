The uploaded image visualizes the actuation pose defined by the constraints you generated. Do you think your constraints for the task solver config can solve your task "TASK_STRING_TEMPLATE", given the pre/post actuation motions can be perfectly defined?  Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

Reminder:
your task name:
TASK_STRING_TEMPLATE

task description:
TASK_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE


=========
Reply explain your reason and then say whether the task solver passes the test (True or False), formatted in a python dictionary, do not miss commas or add extra spaces. Here are some examples.

{
	"task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
	"task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
	"reason": ""
	"pass": "",
}

Please incorporate these feedbacks when you design new task solvers.

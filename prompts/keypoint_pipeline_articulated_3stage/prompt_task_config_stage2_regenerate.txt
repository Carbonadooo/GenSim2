The previous solutions are not feasible. Please regenerate SOLVER_TRIALS new solution configs that are different from the previous ones. 
Remember that you only need to regenerate the pre-actuation motions in the solution config, and not the task or task code.

=========
Please output the SOLVER_TRIALS different configs in order. The pre actuation motions of different configs can be diverse, but their task names should be the same.
Do not output configs that are the same as the previous ones.
Do not use terms that you have not seen before. 
Each config should be in the YAML format as the examples above.
The diversity of the pre-actuation motions can be achieved by using different axes for translation.
Notice that the pre-actuation motions are relative to the actuation pose and the translation motions are represented in corrdinates relative to the manipulator base. 
Please think step by step, try your best to understand the job, and show your reasoning process.

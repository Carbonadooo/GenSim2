The uploaded image sequence visualizes the pre actuation motion defined by the your answer. It represents some waypoints from the initial pose of the arm to the actuation pose. Do you think your generated pre actuation motions for the task solver config can reach the actuation pose you have generated, in the context of your current task "TASK_STRING_TEMPLATE"?  Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

Reminder:
your task name:
TASK_STRING_TEMPLATE

task description:
TASK_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE

Reply explain your reason and then say whether the task solver passes the test (True or False), formatted in a python dictionary, do not miss commas or add extra spaces. Here are some examples.

{
	"task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
	"task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
	"reason": ""
	"pass": "",
}

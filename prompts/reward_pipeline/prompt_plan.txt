We have some manipulation tasks, which need you to generate executable plans according to their descriptions. The plan can only use the following template:

[optional]
The manipulator's palm should move close to `obj`.

[optional]
The manipulator's palm holds `obj` as a tool.

[optional]
The manipulator's palm should grasp `obj`.

[optional]
`obj1` needs to be close to `obj2`.

[optional]
`obj1` needs to be close to `pos`.

[optional]
`obj` needs to be placed at a height of `num`.

[optional]
`obj` needs to be rotated by `num` degrees along `axis_name` axis.

[optional]
`obj` needs to be {open, closed}.

[optional]
The `part1` to `part2` direction of `obj1` needs to be {parallel, perpendicular} to `axis_name` axis.

You should always obey the following rules:
1. Every optional step can be used more than once. If the step has nothing to do with the task, just ignore it.
2. Do not invent new motion descriptions.
3. If the task consists of several sub-tasks, make sure that the manipulator completes the sub-tasks in a proper order.
4. Always replace `obj`/`obj1`/`obj2` with a specific object, which can only be selected from the following list: [bucket, faucet, laptop, box, hammer, ycb, pin, spatula, object].
5. Always replace `num` with a certain numerical value. If you are not sure which value to fill in, just give a value based on your best guess.
6. Always replace `pos` with a certain position. If you are not sure which value to fill in, just give a value based on your best guess.
7. When it comes to `{open, closed}` or `{parallel, perpendicular}`, replace it with one status selected from the given set.
8. Always replace `part1`/'part2' with a specific part, which can only be selected from the following list: [head, tail, side].
9. Always replace `axis_name' with a specific axis, which can only be selected from the following list: [x, y, z].
10. If tools are used in the task, the palm cannot grasp. 
11. When filling in `obj`/`obj1`/`obj2` with specific objects, it is necessary to specify the part of the object, which can be selected from the following list: ['head', 'tail', 'side'].
12. You can never use an object or phrase that is not provided.

Now if you understand, please say yes and tell me what you need to do. Then I will show you some examples for reference.

[example]
Task: Close the laptop
Plan: 
The manipulator's palm should move close to laptop.
Laptop needs to be closed.

[example]
Task: Open the box, place ycb object inside and close it
Plan: 
The manipulator's palm should move close to box.
Box needs to be open.
The manipulator's palm should move close to ycb.
The manipulator's palm should grasp ycb.
YCB should be placed close to box center.
Box needs to be closed.

[example]
Task: Use the hammer to press the pin
Plan:
The manipulator's palm holds hammer as a tool.
Hammer's head needs to be close to pin's head.
The head to tail direction of hammer should be parallel to z axis.
The head to side direction of hammer should be perpendicular to z axis.
Pin's head needs to placed at a height of 0.0.

[example]
Task: use the spatula to scoop the object
Plan:
The manipulator's palm holds spatula as a tool.
Spatula's head needs to be close to object's head.
THe head to tail direction of spatula should be perpendicular to z axis.
The head to side direction of spatula should be perpendicular to z axis.
Object's head needs to placed at a height of 0.5.

Now please write a plan for the new task with the following information:
